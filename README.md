- which models need the least amount of interactions to work

summary of the results

# Baseline values 

In this section, we will assume a network of connectance $\rho$, *i.e.* having
$\rho S^2$ interactions (where $S$ is the species richness), and $(1-\rho) S^2$
non-interactions. Therefore, the vector describing the *true* state of the
network is $\vec o = [\rho, (1-\rho)]$.
